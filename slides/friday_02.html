### **1. Code Resources**

Some places to go if you are interested in leaning more about Python or Bash.

Paul: 

- Matt Miller has a great series of videos on Programming for Cultural Heritage. They are a bit old but still great. 
https://videos.pfch.nyc/

- If you are looking for a "proper", I would highly recommend the executeprogram course:  
https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/python-for-programmers

- Ashley Blewer has an amazing blog around all things AV & Code:

### **6. LLM as code assistant**


Worth noting that when you are working with code you can also of course make use of LLMs. This can be to write an example code to study, explain how some code works, or ask questions about your own code.
